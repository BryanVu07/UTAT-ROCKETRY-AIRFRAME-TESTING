# 8.2 Airframe Testing 

## 8.2.1 Body Tube Bending Testing - Completed

### Objective:
The purpose of this test was to verify the **compressive strength** of carbon fibre body tubes used in the rocket's airframe. Two different tests were conducted: one on a **solid 30-inch tube** and another on a **24-inch tube** with a **QD hole cut**. The results allow for a comparison of the strength and failure points between the two tube configurations, ensuring that the airframe can withstand flight conditions with a large **factor of safety (FOS)**.

### 8.2.1.1  Solid Tube Test:

- **Material & Configuration:**
  - 10-ply carbon fibre body tube with ply orientation of ([0/90/0/90/0/90/0/90/45]s)
  - Length: **30 inches**.
  - Tube attached to the steel bulkhead mount using an **aluminum bulkhead** epoxied to the tube base.
  - The bulkhead design mirrors the "fill bay - ox tank" joint, as this joint experiences the **largest bending moment**.

- **Testing Setup:**
  - The test rig consisted of a **bending rig** (see Figure 66 in the original document).
  - A **steel pipe** was bolted to the composite tube using two **six-bolt rings** (similar to actual airframe connections).
  - A **point load** was applied using a **car jack** at a distance of **1.2 meters** from the base of the rig.

- **Results:**
  - The **tube failed** at an applied load of **360 kg**.
  - Failure occurred on the **compressive (top) side** of the tube, roughly **0.9 meters** from the point of load application.
  - The tube failed at a **bending moment of 3.2 kN-m**, while the maximum load at the bulkhead joint reached **3.5 kN-m**.

- **Observations:**
  - No **bolt tear-out** was observed on either bulkhead, indicating that the bolted connections held firm under the load.
  - A **factor of safety (FOS) of ~7** was determined based on the maximum bending moment experienced during flight.

This test provides important data on the compressive strength and failure points of the **solid carbon fibre tube**, validating its design and confirming that it can endure flight conditions with a significant safety margin.

8.2.1.2 Bending Rigs Test

#### Test Objective:
This test was conducted to evaluate the **compressive strength** and structural integrity of a 24-inch carbon fibre body tube with a **1-inch quick disconnect (QD) hole**. The goal was to determine how this configuration responds to bending forces and assess potential weaknesses due to the hole.

---

#### Test Setup:
- **Material & Ply Configuration:**
  - 10-ply carbon fibre tube with ply orientation: **[0/90/0/90/0/90/0/90/45]s**
  - Length: **24 inches**
  - **1-inch diameter hole** for the nitrous oxide QD system.

- **Mounting & Bulkheads:**
  - The tube was attached to the **steel mount** of the test rig using an **aluminum bulkhead**, which was epoxied to one end of the tube.
  - The bulkhead was an exact replica of the **flight Fill-Ox Tank airframe bulkhead**.
  - The attachment method mimicked real flight conditions, where two **six-bolt rings** were used to fasten the steel bar to the bulkhead, **30ยบ offset** from each other, simulating the bolted airframe connections.

- **Load Application:**
  - A **point load** was applied to the tube using a **car jack** acting on a **steel bar**.
  - The steel bar was bolted to the **testing bulkhead**, and load was applied gradually to simulate bending stress conditions.

---

#### Test Results:
- The **carbon fibre body tube failed** at an applied load of **295 kg**, with failure occurring in compression about **27 inches** from the applied load, at the location of the **QD hole**.
- The failure produced a **bending moment** of **1.98 kN-m**.
- The calculated **factor of safety (FOS)** was approximately **4**, indicating a reasonable margin of safety when compared to the expected flight loads, as determined by aerodynamic analysis.
  
---

#### Observations:
- **No bolt tear-out** was observed on either of the bulkheads, confirming the integrity of the bolted connections.
- The **QD hole** contributed to the failure location, suggesting that further optimization is needed for hole placement to minimize its structural impact.

---

This test provided critical insight into how the carbon fibre tube behaves under bending stress, particularly with access holes. With a factor of safety of 4, the structure remains within acceptable limits, but further refinements in hole placement and configuration may be beneficial for future iterations of the design.
